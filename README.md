Modeling Risk in Physical Settings

## Description
People make intuitive judgements about the riskiness of actions to determine which action to take (e.g. to get $100 for sure, or to flip a coin for a chance to get $200). However, how people use the perceived likelihood of consequences and the severity of the consequences to calculate this risk in physical situations has not been investigated. We asked 45 adults about 9 scenarios in which an animated agent was in the process of crossing a bridge of various widths over a cliff of various depths. In each, we asked the participants to rate the likelihood of failure (the probability that the agent will fall), the severity of the consequences (how bad falling would be), and the risk of the situation as a whole. We modeled these responses and found that the model that best approximates people’s intuitions on risk is the geometric mean between an individual’s likelihood and severity rating for similar ratings of likelihood and severity, and minimum of the two values when there is a larger disparity between them. This highlights a relationship between likelihood of failure or severity of consequences in shaping risk perception that may be specific to physical situations: when either variable is extremely low or extremely high, only one of them will drive intuitions about risk.
